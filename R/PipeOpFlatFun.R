#' @title Flattens Functional Columns
#' @name mlr_pipeops_flatfun
#'
#' @description
#' Convert regular functional features (e.g. all individuals are observed at the same time-points)
#' to new columns, one for each input value to the function.
#'
#' @section Parameters:
#' The parameters are the parameters inherited from [`PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple`], as well as the following
#' parameters:
#' * `affect_columns` :: `function` | [`Selector`][mlr3pipelines::Selector] \cr
#'   [`Selector`][mlr3pipelines::Selector] function, takes a `Task` as argument and returns a `character`
#'   of features to keep. The flattening is only applied to those columns.\cr
#'   See [`Selector`][mlr3pipelines::Selector] for example functions. Default is
#'   selector_all()`, which selects all of the `functional` features.
#'
#' @section Naming:
#' The new names generally append a `_1`, ...,  to the corresponding column name.
#' However this can lead to name clashes with existing columns.
#' This is solved as follows:
#' If a column was called `"x"` and the feature is `"mean"`, the corresponding new column will
#' be called `"x_mean"`. In case of duplicates, unique names are obtained using `make.unique()` and
#' a warning is given.
